# Vue Formular

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vue-formular.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/vue-formular) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matfish2/vue-formular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matfish2/vue-formular)

This vue.js package offers a comperhensive solution for HTML form management, including presentation, validation and (optional) AJAX submission.
When using AJAX, The payload sent to the server will include only changed ("dirty") fields, thus saving redundant data iteration and manipulation on the server side.
The presentation is based on [Bootstrap's form component](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms).

# Dependencies

* Vue.js (>=1.0)
* Bootstrap (CSS)

# Installation

## Option 1 (Recommended)

Compilation requires `browserify` with the `stringify` and `require-globify` transforms.

    npm install vue-formular

Require the script:

    var VueFormular = require('vue-formular');

## Option 2

Import the [standalone compiled script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matfish2/vue-formular/master/dist/vue-formular.min.js)

# Usage

[Check out the live demo](https://jsfiddle.net/matfish2/fjurzoLj/)

## Register the component

    Vue.use(VueFormular, options);

## Create the form

For example:

    <vf-form action="process-form" method="POST" :validation="validation" :options="options">
      <vf-status-bar></vf-status-bar>
      <vf-text label="User name:" name="username"></vf-text>
      <vf-password label="Password:" name="password"></vf-password>
      <vf-submit></vf-submit>
    </vf-form>

Important: to send the form using an AJAX request, add the `ajax` property to `vf-form`.

## Fields

Fields can be used in a form as DIRECT children of the form, or independently (see the `change` event)
All fields accept the following properties:

* `label` `string` `optional`
* `name` `string` `required` field's identifier
* `value` `mixed` `optional`

The following fields are supported:

* `vf-text` - `input[type=text]`
* `vf-number` - `input[type=number]`
* `vf-password` - `input[type=password]`
* `vf-email` - `input[type=email]`
* `vf-textarea` - long text

All of the above accept an optional `placeholder` prop.
Numeric and email fields will be validated accordingly.

* `vf-date` - Datepicker (single or range).

   uses [daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker).
   the `value` should be passed as a string, matching the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, or as a moment object. The date will be sent to the server using `moment`'s [format](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) method (ISO 8601)

   * `range` `boolean` `optional` pick a range of dates. the `value` prop should be passed as an object with `start` and `end` properties. A similar object is sent to the server
   * `format` `string` `optional` Date presentation (using `moment`). Default: 'DD/MM/YYYY'.

* `vf-select` - select list

  * `select2` `object\boolean` `optional` Use select2. accepts options for select2, or nothing
  * `multiple` `boolean` `optional`
  * `items` `array of objects` `required` - item format: `{value:1, text:'Option A'}`
  * `placeholder` `string` Default: 'Select Option'

* `vf-checkbox` - a single boolean checkbox

   * `checked` `boolean` use this instead of `value`

* `vf-buttons-list` - list of radio\checkbox buttons

    * `multiple` `boolean` `optional`
    * `items` same as in `vf-select`

* `vf-file` -
  * `ajax` `boolean` `optional` - use [JQuery File Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload)
  * `options` `object` `optional` - plugin options for this field. merged with the `files` form-level option.

* `vf-submit` - Submit button in a row wrapper, floated to the right. Will be disabled when the form is in pristine state

  * `text` `string` `optional` Button text. Default: 'Submit'

### Slots

All fields have `beforeField` and `afterField` [slots](http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Named_Slots), which allow you to add custom HTML.
`vf-submit` has similar `beforeButton` and `afterButton` slots.

## Validation

passed as an object to the form's `validation` prop.
 An example works best to illustrate the syntax:

       {
            rules: {
                username: {
                    required:true,
                    min: 6
                },
                password: {
                    required:true
                }
            },
            messages:{
                username: {
                    required:"custom message for :field"
                }
            }
        }

The optional `messages` property overides the default messages object for a specific field.

Supported rules:

* `required` `boolean` required fields will be given a unique class you can use to mark the field as required. E.g:

        .VF-Field--required label {
          position: relative;
        }

        .VF-Field--required>label:before {
          content:"*";
          font-size: 20px;
          color:red;
          position: absolute;
          left:-15px;
        }

* `requiredIf` `string` - make the field required only if another field was filled with a value (typically a select or checkbox).
The field would only display when required. To set specific values for requiring the field use the following format: `otherField:val1, val2`
* `email` `boolean` - Automatically set to `true` for `vf-email`
* `number` `boolean` - Automatically set to `true` for `vf-number`
* `min`,`max`,`between` `number` - when the `number` or `integer` rule is set to `true` validates numeric values, otherwise vaidates string length
* `integer` `boolean`
* `digits` `boolean`
* `remote` `string` Validate field on the server end. Accepts a url, to which the value is sent on change event as a request parameter
* `greaterThan`,`smallerThan` `string` accepts the name of the compared field. Compares numbers and dates
* `url` `boolean`

### Custom Rules

To create your own custom rule(s) pass a `customRules` property to the form's options.
the rules are passed as a function that returns `true` if validation passes. e.g:

    customRules: {
      someRule: function(field) {
          return field.value=='something'
      }
    }

### Messages

You can set the default message for the rule, and also override other default messages, by passing a `messages` property to the options object. Defaults are:

    {
        required:'The :field field is required',
        number:'The :field field must be a number',
        integer:'The :field field must be an integer',
        digits:'The :field field must have digits only',
        email:'The :field field must be a valid email address',
        between:{
          string:'The field :field must contain between {0} and {1} characters',
          number:'The field :field must be a number between {0} and {1}',
        },
        min: {
          string:'The :field field must contain at least {0} characters',
          number:'The :field field must be equal to or greater than {0}',
        },
        max: {
          string:'The field :field must contain no more than {0} characters',
          number:'The field :field must be equal to or smaller than {0}',
        },
        remote:'Remote Error',
        requiredIf:'The field :field is required',
        url:'Please enter a valid URL',
        greaterThan:'The field :field must be greater than :relatedField',
        smallerThan:'The field :field must be smaller than :relatedField'
      }

### Server-side validation (when using AJAX to send the form)

Sometimes you might want to do some extra validation on the server side, after the form is sent (i.e no client-side validation errors).
If server-side validation fails simply return some invalid code (e.g 400). The response content will be displayed in the status bar.
If you want to display more than one error, you can return an object, consisting of `field_name:message` pairs. The messages will be displayed in a list and will each link to its corresponding field (same as client-side errors when `showClientErrorsInStatusBar` is set to `true`).

## Events

`vue-formular.sending` (ajax form)

Fires off when the form is being sent. Sends through the form data. A message will automatically appear in the status bar.

`vue-formular.sent` (ajax form)

Fires off after the form has been sent successfully. Sends through the form data. The status bar will show the response returned from the server, if it is a string, or else the designtaed text.

`vue-formular.invalid` (ajax form)

Fires off after the form returned an invalid response from the server. Sends through the response

`vue-formular.change::field_name`

Fires off whenever a field's value is changed. Send through the new and old values.
This allows for using fields independently of the form.

## Form Options

Options are set in three layers, where the more particular overrides the more general.

1. Pre-defined defaults.
2. User-defined defaults for the global Vue Instance. Passed as the second paramter to the `Use` statement.
3. Options for a single form, passed through the `options` prop.

* `layout` `string` Bootstrap's form layout class. Defaults to a vertical block display. other options are `form-horizontal` and `form-inline`
When using a layout other than `form-horizontal` adjust the `top` rule of the `form-control-feedback` class to get the feedback icon aligned with the field.
* `labelWidth` `number` relevant only for horizontal layout. The number of grid columns allocated for the label. Defaults to `3`.
* `showClientErrorsInStatusBar` `boolean` Show client errors in the status bar, with links to the relevant fields, in addition to the error shown under each field. Useful for long forms. Deault: `false`
* `additionalPayload` `object` Custom data you want to send along with the form. Serves a similar purpose to that of a hidden input field
* `files` `object` - Options for [JQuery File Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload), to be used on `vf-file` with an `ajax` prop.
* `customRules` `object` See [above](#custom-rules)
* `messages` `object` see [above](#messages)
* `texts` `object` Default:

        {
          sending:'Sending Form...',
          sent:'Form was successfully sent', // this will be presented in case a string is not returned from the server
          singleError:'an error was found:', // status bar errors list title
          errors:'{0} errors were found:'
        }
